# the 1b mutation only once, on the branch leading to tips B and C
# thus we expect the clade label to be on node `internalAB`
cladeCB	nuc	1	B
# the 2c mutation appears twice -- on branch `internalAB` and `internalDEF`
# as the latter has 3 descendants, it is chosen over the former
cladeDEF	nuc	2	C
# mutation 3e appears only on a terminal node (tipE)
# but we still expect both a branch label and a node_attr
# this means that tipE should be annotated "cladeE" and _not_ "cladeDEF"
